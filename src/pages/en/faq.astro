    question: 'What is Motekita?',
    answer: 'Motekita is a desktop application that monitors email reception and notifies you with cute dog animations. It aims to provide a "playing with a dog" experience rather than just being a notification tool.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Can you see my email content?',
    answer: 'No. Motekita never retrieves email content. It only retrieves the sender name, email address, and subject line. It is designed with privacy as the top priority.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Which email services are supported?',
    answer: 'The free version supports Gmail. The Premium version also supports Outlook.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Where is my data stored?',

  },
  {
    question: 'What\'s the difference between free and paid versions?',
    answer: 'The free version includes Gmail notifications and basic dog animations. The Premium version ($5 one-time) adds spam detection and Outlook support.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What is DLC (additional content)?',
    answer: 'DLC allows you to purchase additional dog breeds (Shiba Inu, Husky, etc.) and costumes. These are purely for customization and do not affect the app\'s core functionality.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Will the app slow down my computer?',
    answer: 'Motekita is designed to use less than 50MB of memory and less than 1% CPU. It\'s lightweight enough to run in the background without affecting your computer\'s performance.',
